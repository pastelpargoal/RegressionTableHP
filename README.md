I posted two codes so far: HP_Maps_Full_Regression and HP_DataSetUp
HP_DataSetUp - it's about extracting datasets from census and heat pump data then do data cleaning to create an ultimate dataset - CTj
HP_Maps_Full_Regression - I used the dataset, CTj, that was created in the HP_DataSetUp to start the analysis. First, I do more data cleaning, create a spaital term (there's spatial autocorrelation), create a forward regression model, 
and plot maps. There are more details about everything in the code.
