I posted three codes so far: HP_Maps_Full_Regression, HP_DataSetUp, HP_Strat_Regressions, and HP_DescriptiveStats
HP_DataSetUp - it's about extracting datasets from census and heat pump data then do data cleaning to create an ultimate dataset - CTj
HP_Maps_Full_Regression - I used the dataset, CTj, that was created in the HP_DataSetUp to start the analysis. First, I do more data cleaning, create a spaital term (there's spatial autocorrelation), create a forward regression model, 
and plot maps. There are more details about everything in the code.
HP_Strat_Regressions - I running the stepwise forward regression stratifed by each race/ethnicity group then I create a table with the results. I do this twice: with and without spatial term
HP_DescriptiveStats - THis is creating the descriptive statistics table between the relationship of Heat pumps (depedent variable) and predictors.
